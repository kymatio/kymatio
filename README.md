kymatio: wavelet scattering in PyTorch
======================================

kymatio is a Python module for wavelets and scattering transforms, built on top of PyTorch.

Use kymatio if you need a library that:
* integrates wavelet scattering in a deep learning architecture,
* supports 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D wavelets, and
* runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU hardware.


## Installation

The software was tested on Linux with anaconda Python 2.7 and
various GPUs, including Titan X, 1080s, 980s, K20s, and Titan X Pascal.

The first step is to install pytorch following instructions from
<http://pytorch.org>, then you can run `pip`:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

The software uses PyTorch + NumPy FFT on CPU, and PyTorch + CuPy + CuFFT on GPU.

This code unifies multiple previous efforts:
    - pyscatwave/scatwave
    - scatnetlight 
    - others 
    

## Usage

Example:

```python
import torch
from scattering.scattering import Scattering

scattering = Scattering(M=32, N=32, J=2).cuda()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32).cuda()

print scattering(x).size()
```

## Benchmarks
We do some simple timings and comparisons to the previous (multi-core CPU) implementation of scattering (ScatnetLight). We benchmark the software using a 1080 GPU. Below we show input sizes (WxHx3xBatchSize) and speed:

32 × 32 × 3 × 128 (J=2)- 0.03s (speed of 8x vs ScatNetLight)

256 × 256 × 3 × 128 (J=2) - 0.71 s (speed up of 225x vs ScatNetLight)
