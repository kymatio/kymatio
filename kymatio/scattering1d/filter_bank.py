def adaptive_choice_P(sigma, eps=1e-7):
    """
    Adaptive choice of the value of the number of periods in the frequency
    domain used to compute the Fourier transform of a Morlet wavelet.

    This function considers a Morlet wavelet defined as the sum
    of
    * a Gabor term hat psi(omega) = hat g_{sigma}(omega - xi)
    where 0 < xi < 1 is some frequency and g_{sigma} is
    the Gaussian window defined in Fourier by
    hat g_{sigma}(omega) = e^{-omega^2/(2 sigma^2)}
    * a low pass term \\hat \\phi which is proportional to \\hat g_{\\sigma}.

    If \\sigma is too large, then these formula will lead to discontinuities
    in the frequency interval [0, 1] (which is the interval used by numpy.fft).
    We therefore choose a larger integer P >= 1 such that at the boundaries
    of the Fourier transform of both filters on the interval [1-P, P], the
    magnitude of the entries is below the required machine precision.
    Mathematically, this means we would need P to satisfy the relations:

    |\\hat \\psi(P)| <= eps and |\\hat \\phi(1-P)| <= eps

    Since 0 <= xi <= 1, the latter implies the former. Hence the formula which
    is easily derived using the explicit formula for g_{\\sigma} in Fourier.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sigma: float
        Positive number controlling the bandwidth of the filters
    eps : float, optional
        Positive number containing required precision. Defaults to 1e-7

    P : int
        integer controlling the number of periods used to ensure the
        periodicity of the final Morlet filter in the frequency interval

        interval [1-P, P[, so that there are 2*P - 1 periods.

        on max_subsampling and the characteristics of the filters.
        Each value for k is an array (or tensor) of size 2**(J_support - k)
        containing the Fourier transform of the filter after subsampling by
        2**k

    Parameters
    ----------
    J_support : int
        2**J_support is the desired support size of the filters
    J_scattering : int
        parameter for the scattering transform (2**J_scattering
        corresponds to the averaging support of the low-pass filter)
    Q : int
        number of wavelets per octave at the first order. For audio signals,
        a value Q >= 12 is recommended in order to separate partials.
    r_psi : float, optional
        Should be >0 and <1. Controls the redundancy of the filters
        (the larger r_psi, the larger the overlap between adjacent wavelets).
        Defaults to sqrt(0.5).
    criterion_amplitude : float, optional
        Represents the numerical error which is allowed to be lost after
        convolution and padding. Defaults to 1e-3.
    normalize : string, optional
        Normalization convention for the filters (in the
        temporal domain). Supported values include 'l1' and 'l2'; a ValueError
        is raised otherwise. Defaults to 'l1'.
    max_subsampling: int or None, optional
        maximal dyadic subsampling to compute, in order
        to save computation time if it is not required. Defaults to None, in
        which case this value is dynamically adjusted depending on the filters.
    sigma0 : float, optional
        parameter controlling the frequential width of the
        low-pass filter at J_scattering=0; at a an absolute J_scattering, it
        is equal to sigma0 / 2**J_scattering. Defaults to 1e-1
    alpha : float, optional
        tolerance factor for the aliasing after subsampling.
        The larger alpha, the more conservative the value of maximal
        subsampling is. Defaults to 5.
    P_max : int, optional
        maximal number of periods to use to make sure that the Fourier
        transform of the filters is periodic. P_max = 5 is more than enough for
        double precision. Defaults to 5. Should be >= 1
    eps : float, optional
        required machine precision for the periodization (single
        floating point is enough for deep learning applications).
        Defaults to 1e-7

    Returns
    -------
    phi_f : dictionary
        a dictionary containing the low-pass filter at all possible
        subsamplings. See above for a description of the dictionary structure.
        The possible subsamplings are controlled by the inputs they can
        receive, which correspond to the subsamplings performed on top of the
        1st and 2nd order transforms.
    psi1_f : dictionary
        a dictionary containing the band-pass filters of the 1st order,
        only for the base resolution as no subsampling is used in the
        scattering tree.
        Each value corresponds to a dictionary for a single filter, see above
        for an exact description.
        The keys of this dictionary are of the type (j, n) where n is an
        integer counting the filters and j the maximal dyadic subsampling
        which can be performed on top of the filter without aliasing.
    psi2_f : dictionary
        a dictionary containing the band-pass filters of the 2nd order
        at all possible subsamplings. The subsamplings are determined by the
        input they can receive, which depends on the scattering tree.
        Each value corresponds to a dictionary for a single filter, see above
        for an exact description.
        The keys of this dictionary are of th etype (j, n) where n is an
        integer counting the filters and j is the maximal dyadic subsampling
        which can be performed on top of this filter without aliasing.
    t_max_phi : int
        temporal size to use to pad the signal on the right and on the
        left by making at most criterion_amplitude error. Assumes that the
        temporal support of the low-pass filter is larger than all filters.
