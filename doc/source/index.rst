Kymatio is a Python module for computing wavelet and scattering transforms.

It is built on top of PyTorch, but also has a fast CUDA backend via cupy and
skcuda.

Use kymatio if you need a library that:

* integrates wavelet scattering in a deep learning architecture,
* supports 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D scattering transforms
* differentiable transforms for applications in generative modeling, reconstruction and more!
* runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU hardware.

A brief intro to wavelet scattering is provided in :ref:`user-guide`. For a
list of publications see
`Publications <https://www.di.ens.fr/data/publications>`_.
